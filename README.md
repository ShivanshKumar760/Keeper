# Google Keep Clone - A Note-Taking Application

This is a clone of **Google Keep**, built with **React** and the powerful **useState** hook. The app allows users to create, view, and manage personal notes with ease, mimicking the functionality of Google Keep. It provides an intuitive, clean user interface where users can:

- **Create new notes**: Quickly add notes with a title and description, making it easy to jot down ideas, reminders, and important information.
- **Edit existing notes**: Modify the content of previously created notes to keep them up-to-date.
- **Delete notes**: Remove unwanted notes, ensuring your collection stays organized and clutter-free.
- **Responsive design**: The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **State management with `useState`**: Using React's `useState`, the app efficiently manages the dynamic creation, editing, and deletion of notes without requiring complex state management libraries.

## Features:
- **Add and remove notes** with a simple, user-friendly interface.
- **Responsive layout** that works on all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
- **Local state management** using React’s `useState` hook to track and update notes in real-time.
- **Simple and fast UI** for an enhanced user experience, similar to Google Keep.

This project serves as a great demonstration of React’s core concepts, such as state management with hooks, and the ability to create modern web apps with a clean, intuitive UI.
